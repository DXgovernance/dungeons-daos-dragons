# Dungeons DAOs and Dragons

Dungeons, daos and dragons is exactly what it sounds like, we wont say too much yet but the plan is to build an on chain game with daos competing against each other with signed voting, dungeon masters moderating games and receiving payments, bounties and NFT rewards. 

The original game Dungeons and Dragons relies heavily on the Dungeon Master and his responsibility to make sure that all the heroes of the adventure have a great time, it is the dungeon master who enforces the rules of the game but also allowing for unexpected things to happen like any other adventure.

In this times where we rely more and more on technology and their increasing computational power that is becoming very close to our real lives we think it is super important to continue using the imagination of the human brain as a tool or machine (still the most powerful one) to create this abstracts but cryptographicaly enforced solution.

As if being part of a magical world on a great adventure were not enough we want to see how organizations would see reflected in their heroes, how they will act, how serious would they take it and how far would they go to make sure their hero survives, win and with this, show the power behind a collective.
